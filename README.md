Merge sort written in Java, practice Divide and Conquer

### Designing Algorithms: Merge Sort
- Uses Divide-and-Conquer approach:
	- *Divide* the n-element sequence into two subsequences of n/2
	- *Conquer* sort the two subsequeences recursively using merge sort
	- *Combine* merge the two sorted subsequences to produce the sorted answer
